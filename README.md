# FindYourNeighborhood
## Introduction  
This project is designed to help people find the similar neighborhood in Houston as the one they are fond of. It can be useful for business expansion like choosing a new branch’s location, or for the new comer to choose the comfortable place to settle down with the similar environment as the one they’ve enjoyed before. 

So basically, this project would ask user for two inputs. One is the zip code for the template neighborhood. The other one is the target zip code for the possible neighborhoods. Then the project would analyze the data of the surrounding venues for the template zip code by Foursquare (in a small radius), and compare the similarity with the neighborhoods from the target zip code (in a larger radius). The result would demonstrate the top three neighborhoods with the highest similarities for user to choose.
